            I love programming, but I don't have much programming experience. I have tried to learn a little Javascript, but it's kind of challenging, and the technique I leaerned is elementary. I have systematically studied python in school, so I have a clear understanding of computer logic. Now I am studying web design and development. This website is one of my works.
