            In such a special year like 2020, people are working harder for their lives. Holiday in such a special season will also be endowed with more significance. I hope to bring people some inspiring short films to convey warmth. So this clip "That's Christmas to Me" was created.
            <br> <br>
            I got my inspiration from this song and wanted to show people that "there is always a way to be loved", especially during this special season.
