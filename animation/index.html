            Have you ever fantasized about the future of transportation? Will the future of transportation change our lifestyle? With these questions in mind, I conceived a high-tech society of the future based on modern society. In the future, humans would travel by "light train" to different planets in the solar system, and the way they travel by "light train" is very similar to the way we travel today.
            <br> <br>
            In this animation, I conceived and depicted the scene of the three stages of check-in, boarding, and takeoff. The overall style of the animation is relaxed and enjoyable, just as I look forward to the future of travel - exciting and relaxing, no matter where you go.
